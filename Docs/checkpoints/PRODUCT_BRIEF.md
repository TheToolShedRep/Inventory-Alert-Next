# Inventory Alert System

## Product Brief

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** 2026-02-18
**Status:** Operational (Phase 1 Complete)

---

# 1️⃣ Product Overview

The Inventory Alert System is a low-cost, automation-driven inventory monitoring platform built specifically for small to mid-sized food businesses.

It replaces:

- Manual stock checks
- Spreadsheet guesswork
- Surprise stockouts
- Over-ordering
- Morning “what are we out of?” chaos

With:

- Automated daily inventory math
- Smart reorder detection
- Shopping list generation
- Email alerts before stock runs out

The system runs quietly every morning and tells owners exactly what needs attention.

---

# 2️⃣ The Problem

Small restaurants and cafés typically:

- Track inventory manually
- Order reactively
- Run out of key ingredients unexpectedly
- Over-order perishable items
- Have no real visibility into depletion

Most POS systems do not provide true inventory intelligence.

Owners rely on:

- Memory
- Handwritten notes
- Last-minute vendor calls

This leads to:

- Waste
- Stress
- Revenue loss
- Operational inefficiency

---

# 3️⃣ The Solution

The Inventory Alert System connects:

- POS sales data
- Recipe ingredient mappings
- Purchase records
- Reorder thresholds

And automatically calculates:

```
On-Hand Inventory = Purchases − Theoretical Usage
```

Every morning it:

1. Recalculates inventory
2. Checks reorder points
3. Generates a shopping list
4. Emails owners

No manual counting required (except periodic verification).

---
